## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages

In your repository settings:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Set **Source** to "GitHub Actions"
3. Save the configuration

### 2. Repository Permissions

The workflow includes these permissions:
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write
```

### 3. Workflow Configuration

The updated workflow (`.github/workflows/benchmarks.yml`) includes:

- **`clean-reports`**: Clears old reports
- **`benchmarks`**: Runs benchmarks for each technology
- **`generate-html-report`**: Creates HTML from JSON reports
- **`deploy`**: Deploys to GitHub Pages

### 4. Automatic Deployment

Reports are automatically deployed when:
- Code is pushed to the `workflow` branch
- Pull requests are created
- Monthly on the 1st (scheduled)
- Manually triggered via workflow dispatch

## 📂 File Structure

```
reports/
├── index.html              # Main HTML report (generated)
├── report_YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SSZ.json  # JSON data files
└── ...more JSON reports
```

## 🌐 Accessing Reports

After deployment, reports will be available at:
```
https://[your-username].github.io/Benchie-techs/
```

## 🔄 Report Generation Process

1. **JSON Collection**: Gather all JSON reports from benchmark runs
2. **Data Aggregation**: Combine and analyze performance data
3. **HTML Generation**: Create rich HTML with embedded charts
4. **GitHub Pages Deploy**: Upload and serve the report

## 📊 Sample Report Content

Based on your current data, the report shows:

### System Info
- **OS**: darwin (arm64)
- **CPU**: PriM31415  
- **Cores**: 8
- **Memory**: 16,384 MB

### Performance Results
- **Go file_read**: 13,516.25 ops/sec (🚀 Excellent)
- **Memory Usage**: 21.1 MB
- **CPU Usage**: 66.3%
- **Execution Time**: 73.98ms

### Technology Comparison
When multiple technologies are tested, the report will show:
- Side-by-side performance comparisons
- Memory efficiency rankings
- CPU utilization patterns
- Execution time distributions

## 🎯 Key Benefits

## 🚀 Advanced Features

### Custom Styling
Modify the CSS in `getStyles()` method to match your brand:
- Color schemes
- Typography
- Layouts
- Charts appearance

### Additional Metrics
Extend the `Metrics` struct in Go to include:
- Network latency
- Disk I/O statistics
- Custom performance indicators

### Report Scheduling
Adjust the cron schedule in the workflow:
```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '0 0 * * *'  # Daily
  - cron: '0 0 * * 1'  # Weekly (Mondays)
  - cron: '0 0 1 * *'  # Monthly (current)
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Reports Not Deploying
- Check repository Pages settings
- Verify workflow permissions
- Review GitHub Actions logs

### Missing Charts
- Ensure Chart.js CDN is accessible
- Check browser JavaScript console
- Verify JSON data structure
